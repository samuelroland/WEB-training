# WEB-training
Small WEB exos to train HTML, CSS and JavaScript

My solutions can be found in the `solution` branch as separated file named `solution.js` or `solution.html`.

## Exo styling
Folder: `styling`

Install the Live Server extension in VSCode, open `styling/index.html` and start designing this page:

TODO: make the page train flexbox and grid

## Drill exos

Install NPM dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npx vitest --bail 1
```
and run tests (the `--bail 1` make the runner stop at first fail so you can see output of failed test one after the other). Vitest run tests in watch mode by default so open your terminal along your IDE so you can see both !
